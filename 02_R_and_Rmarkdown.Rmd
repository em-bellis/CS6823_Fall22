## What is R?
- R is a **language** and **environment** for statistical computing and graphics  

- Generally (but see [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html)), is a functional language, but also has aspects of object oriented programming (described in more detail [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html))


## Why R?

-  Free, open source, and available on every major platform
-  Community (R User Groups & local meet-ups, [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org), #rstats and #r4ds on twitter)
-  So many good packages!
-  Communication (R Shiny & R Markdown)
-  Integrated development environment (R Studio)
-  Connect to C, Fortran, C++
-  Cutting-edge tools, thanks to researchers in statistics and machine learning


## quiRks

- Many users are not programmers; software engineering best practices not always adhered to
- Inconsistency across contributed packages
- Can be very slow and memory-intensive

## Resources for R
**For the language:**  
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) an interactive package  
- [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) materials from workshops freely available

## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

- Provides a standard way of formatting text, like  

  *italics*  
  **bold**  
  `code`  
  [links](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  
  Latex equations,  $E = mc^{2}$  
  and bibliographies <!-- This is a comment. -->

## What is Markdown?

- BUT original version did not include syntax for tables, footnotes, math expressions, or citations

- Enter **pandoc**, a 'swiss-army knife' for converting between markup formats (https://pandoc.org)

- *A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text; markup language is not shown when the document is processed for display*

## What is R Markdown?

- "R markdown" document format was first introduced in 2012 as part of **knitr** package, enabling users to embed code chunks in Markdown documents.

- The **rmarkdown** package, first created in 2014, provides an 'ecosystem' for authoring documents.

<!-- ## Slide with R Output -->
<!-- ```{r cars, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Slide with Plot -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## What is R Markdown? -->
<!-- R Markdown also supports other languages, such as Python, Julia, C++, and SQL thanks to the **knitr** package, which provides a large number of language engines. Language engines are essentially functions registered in the object `knitr::knit_engine`. -->
<!-- ```{r knitr, echo=TRUE} -->
<!-- names(knitr::knit_engines$get()) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Rendering a .Rmd file
* R Studio:    
    * Click the **Knit** button to generate document that includes both content and output of any embedded R code chunks within the document  


* R Console:  

`rmarkdown::render('/path/to/file/Intro.Rmd')`


* CLI:  

`Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('./Intro.Rmd')"`
