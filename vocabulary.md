**non-parametric model:** does not assume a specific form of relationship

**classification:**	problems with a qualitative (or categorical) response

**regression:**	problems with a quantitative response

**method of least squares:** approach to estimate coefficients in linear regression model that minimizes the RSS

## Training and Related Terms
**training dataset:** set of data used to estimate f

**test dataset:** hold out set used to estimate model performance

**curse of dimensionality:** with increasing number of predictors, the distance between observations in predictor space increases exponentially

## Measuring Error
**error:**  difference in observed response compared to predicted response

**MSE:**  one measure of measuring model error; mean squared error; ((1/n) * SUM(ySubI - fHat(xSubI))^2)

**variance:** the amount our prediction changes from one training set to another

**bias:** error introduced by approximating a complicated model by a simpler one

**flexibility:**  ability for model to fit the data

**residual:** difference in observed and predicted response

**Residual Sum of Squares:** sum of squared residuals across observations in dataset

**Residual Standard Error:** average amount the response will deviate from the true regression line

**R^2:** proportion of variability explained by f(X)

## Assumptions
**collinearity:** when there exists a linear relationship between two predictors
