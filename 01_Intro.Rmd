## Introduction to Statistical Learning (2013) 
- More of a hands-on introduction to computational aspects of statistical learning with real-world data.  
- Uses R as 'the language of choice for academic statisticians' (also a bridge across disciplines!)

## Statistical Learning Approaches   
**Supervised methods**  

  + Regression  (observe input & quantitative output)

  + Classification  (observe input & categorical output)
  
**Unsupervised methods**  

  + Data are not labeled (observe only input)

  + Goal may be learning relationships among variables and data structure (e.g. how many population clusters are there?)

## Supervised Learning: Regression or Classification?
- Predicting whether or not a patient has cancer based on expression patterns of 5,000 genes?
- Predicting quantity of a certain protein, given expression patterns of 5,000 genes?
- Estimating plant height according to variation at 5,000 positions in the genome?
- Determine whether pixels in a satellite image indicate an agricultural field, river, or forest?
- Determine how many different types of bacterial communities have been sampled using microbiome sequence data from 10 tissues? 

## Another definition...        
Consider a quantitative response, $Y$, and $p$ different predictors, $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$. 

We  assume some relationship between $Y$ and $X= (X_1, X_2,..., X_p)$, which can be written in the general form: $$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$   
where $f$ is a fixed but unknown function of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$ and $\epsilon$ is a random error term which is independent of $X$ and has mean zero.

## What is Statistical Learning?

How should we choose what tool to use to estimate $f(X)$?

## Why estimate $f$?    
  1\. Prediction

</center>

## 
Considering our prediction of $Y$: 
$$\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)$$ 
The expected value of the squared error is then:
$$E(Y - \hat{Y})^2 = [f(X) - \hat{f}(X)]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)$$
**We can choose different modeling techniques to improve our estimate of ${f}$, and minimize the reducible error.**

## Why estimate $f$?  
  2\. Inference  
  
+ Which predictors are associated with the response?  
+ What is the relationship between the response and each predictor?  
+ Can the relationship between $Y$ and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is it more complicated?

## Trade-offs: Flexibility vs. interpretability    
- Whether we are interested in inference vs. prediction influences how we choose to estimate $f$.
- It determines whether we might choose a **parametric** vs. **non-parametric** approach.

</center>

## Parametric methods  
- Assume a specific form for $f$.
    - e.g. the linear model is an example of a parametric model.
$$f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 +\beta_1X_2+ ...+ \beta_pX_p$$  

- Fit/train the model 
    - e.g. using ordinary least squares (Chp. 3) or other methods (Chp. 6). 
    
- Instead of having to estimate an arbitrary $p$-dimensional function, we only need to estimate $p + 1$ coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_p$.  
<center>  

## Non-parametric methods
- Do not make explicit assumptions about the form of $f$.  
- More flexible, can provide a better fit to $f$.

## Non-parametric methods
- Typically need larger sample size compared to parametric approach to get accurate estimate of $f$.
- Can suffer from overfitting (model learns 'noise' in the training data & performs well on training data but poorly on test data)
- More difficult to interpret

## Measuring the Quality of Fit  
- In regression, one commonly used measure is the mean squared error (MSE).
- The MSE is a measure of how close the predicted response is to the true response for an observation.
$$MSE = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \widehat{f}(x_i))^2$$
- We want to choose the method that gives the lowest MSE on a *testing* dataset, not the lowest MSE on a *training* dataset

## Measuring the Quality of Fit 
- No guarantee that the model with the lowest training MSE will also have the lowest test MSE.
- Note characteristic 'U-shape' of test MSE (red).

Right: Training MSE (grey curve) and testing MSE (red curve)

## Measuring the Quality of Fit 
- Depending on the true shape of $f$, more interpretable methods like linear regression may provide a very good fit to the data.

## How do we minimize the expected test MSE?   
Imagine repeatedly estimating $f$ using a using a large number of training sets, and testing each of the $\widehat{f}$ at a given value, $x_0$. 

**The expected test MSE at $x_0$ is given by:**
$$\mathbb{E}(y_0 - \widehat{f}(x_0))^2 = \text{Var}(\widehat{f}(x_0)) + [\text{Bias}(\widehat{f}(x_0))]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)$$
Average across all $x_0$ in test set to get overall expected test MSE.

<!-- Proof for the bias-variance decomposition of MSE can be found [here](https://cscherrer.github.io/post/bias-variance/). -->


## Trade-off: Bias vs. Variance   
To minimize the average test error, we need to select a statistical learning method that simultaneously has low variance and low bias.

## Trade-off: Bias vs. Variance  
*Variance* is the amount by which $\widehat{f}$ changes from one training set to another. Ideally, $\widehat{f}$ does not change a lot between different training sets.
$$\text{Var}(\hat f(x))=\mathbb{E}[(\hat f(x)-\mu)^2]$$ 
where $\mu=\mathbb{E}[\hat f(x)]$  

More flexible methods generally have higher variance.

## Trade-off: Bias vs. Variance  
*Bias* refers to the error introduced by approximating a complicated problem by a much simpler model.

$$\text{Bias}(\hat f(x)) = \mathbb{E}(\hat f(x))-f(x)$$   

More flexible methods generally have lower bias.  


## Trade-off: Bias vs. Variance   
The 'best' method (low variance AND low bias) depends on the true form of $f$.

## Model Accuracy in Classification
- The test error rate is minimized on average by a simple classifier (the Bayes classifier) that *assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values.*
- Test error is given by $$\text{Avg}(I(y_0 \ne \hat y_0)) $$ where $I(y_0 \ne \hat y_0) = 1$ if $y_0 \ne \hat y_0$ but 0 otherwise.


## Model Accuracy in Classification
With 2 classes, Bayes decision boundary corresponds to predicting class one if $Pr(Y=1 | X=x_0) > 0.5$ and class two otherwise

</center>
ISL Fig. 2.13; Purple dashed line: Bayes decision boundary

## Non-parametric classification: KNN
In reality, we never know the conditional probability of $Y$ given $X$! The Bayes Classifier boundary is therefore an unattainable 'gold standard'. But, we can estimate it using various methods (logistic regression, KNN classification, LDA, QDA).

## In summary: 
- Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data, and estimating $f(X)$.

- How we choose $f(x)$ is shaped by a trade-offs. 

- Whether we are more interested in accuracy vs. interpretability determines whether we might choose a more flexible model and whether the model is characterized by relatively higher bias vs. variance.
